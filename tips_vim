switch tabs in vim
open a new file within the current vim tab :tabnew filename
Why not use tabs (introduced in Vim 7)? You can switch between tabs with :tabn and :tabp, With  :tabe <filepath> 
you can add a new tab; and with a regular :q or :wq you close a tab. If you map :tabn and :tabp to your F7/F8 keys 
you can easily switch between files.

Position the cursor where you want to begin cutting.
Press v to select characters (or uppercase V to select whole lines).
Move the cursor to the end of what you want to cut.
Press d to cut (or y to copy).
Move to where you would like to paste.
Press P to paste before the cursor, or p to paste after.
Copy and paste is performed with the same steps except for step 4 where you would press y instead of d:

d = delete = cut

y = yank = copy

gg move cursor to the top
G move cursor to the bottom

j go down;k go up;l move right;h move left

i insert before the cursor; I insert at begining of the line
a append text following current cursor position;A append text to the end of current line
